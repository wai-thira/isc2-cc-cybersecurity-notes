# Security Principles

## CIA Triad
The CIA triad represents the three core goals of cybersecurity:
- Confidentiality: Prevent unauthorized access to information
- Integrity: Ensure data is accurate and not altered
- Availability: Ensure systems and data are accessible when needed

## Defense in Depth
Defense in depth uses multiple layers of security controls to protect
systems. If one control fails, others still provide protection.

## Least Privilege
Users and systems should only be given the minimum access required
to perform their tasks. This reduces the impact of compromise.

## Risk
Risk is the possibility of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.
Organizations manage risk rather than eliminate it completely.
