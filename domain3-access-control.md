# Access Control

## Authentication vs Authorization
- Authentication verifies who a user is
- Authorization determines what a user is allowed to do

## Access Control Models
- DAC (Discretionary Access Control)
- MAC (Mandatory Access Control)
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

## Account Management
Accounts should be reviewed regularly and disabled when no longer needed
to reduce security risks.
